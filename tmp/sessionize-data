For hours it seems like there’s been nothing but work crises to deal with, but finally, you’re home. As you approach your driveway you tell your phone to open the garage door, ... but nothing happens. It’s happened again: the cloud service controlling your garage door is on the fritz. Now you have to try to find what you were hoping would become a quaint artifact of a bygone era, the garage door opener. Luckily, this isn’t your first rodeo, so you fish it out of its hidden place behind a nearby planter. The automation that normally recognizes you from presence detection software running on that same cloud service also fails, so you fish for your keys to the back door. It’s raining, and it’s cold. And now you’re not sure you remembered to bring your keys after all. You longingly think back to the promise of home automation, when you thought you wouldn’t have to fumble for keys, or garage door openers ever again. You reflect on your predicament, and wonder how it could have all gone so terribly wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever dabbled in smart homes or home automation you’re probably been there. The truth is home automation these days is almost synonymous with the cloud. Wander down any home improvement store, or run any Google search, and the vast majority of smart home offerings are underpinned by varied, and often conflicting, cloud services and standards. Sure, “Works with Alexa” is helpful, and the ease of just plugging it in, setting up some credentials, and configuring automations is extremely seductive, but what happens if Alexa, or rather AWS, goes down in your area? Or more prosaically, what if your internet goes down?\r\n\r\nA better solution can be found in self-hosting your smart home. It takes more time, effort, and maintenance, but what you lose in instant gratification, you gain in knowing exactly what makes everything tick, and in the knowledge that if it goes down you know what to do. In this talk, I will present what building a self-hosted smart home entails, both the good and the bad. I will cover overall design decisions you will have to make and how to plan your process, including answering the all-important question, “how do I find smart home products that are cloud independent”?. I will also cover how to connect your devices to locally-running APIs, and how to bring it all together in one central panel. I will end by discussing three essential smart home items, and how to engineer them yourself in a way your whole family will feel confident using them. \r\n1. Garage door opener\r\n2. LED smart light\r\n3. Central, open-source, control center\r\n\r\nWhile this won’t be a coding session, code will be discussed, even shown. Join me as we discuss the true smart home of the future; the self-hosted smart home.\r\n","startsAt":"2023-10-19T09:10:00","endsAt":"2023-10-19T10:00:00","speakers":["a325da59-57f5-4b3a-a300-e266f5880b4e"],"categoryItems":[167587,167592,167597,167600,167605],"roomId":35721},{"id":"489354","title":"A Great Big Useable Tomorrow: Disney's Approach to User Experience","description":"Walt Disney.

While this is important, there has been a lack of focus on emotional requirements (feelings that the the product or service should induce in its users). Why is this important?\r\n\r\nBecause the way we feel is important and should be considered!\r\n\r\nA bold claim? Perhaps. And, as with any claim, it should be supported with evidence.  In this talk, I stress the importance of emotional requirements and support the claim by providing relevant facts, opinions, statistics, quotations, examples, hypotheticals, and more.  Once I’ve sufficiently supported the claim, I offer a few practical methods by which to gather, induce, and test emotional requirements.

We send a request, and we receive a response. We might get a whole page back, or we might get some data to render, but the common thread for almost every web application that has ever been built is the request/response cycle. What if we didn’t have to do it this way?

You’ve already used it if you’ve worked with Redux or Elm. We are going to stretch this pattern just a little: we will publish events from the client, use reducer functions on the server to compute our new state, and subscribe to these state changes on the client.\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore this idea with several code examples that gradually increase in complexity. We’ll see how building collaborative and real-time applications becomes natural and straightforward.

It doesn’t matter if that answer is the best-case, average, or worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe answer is fundamentally wrong because using a single value hides the fact that what we really meant was a distribution of possible dates, durations, or outcomes. The exact value is uncertain. Development may be faster or slower than we thought. What if the tech lead wins the lottery and retires? What if a global pandemic forces us to change the way we work?\r\n\r\nWhile we can’t control any of those factors, we can be mindful of their existence and communicate more clearly. In this talk we will introduce “bet” language, which makes uncertainty and luck an explicit part of the conversation.

Join us as we share our journey of building a highly available and fault-tolerant caching solution while leveraging automation to achieve a faster MTTR.\r\n\r\nPayment systems that support real-time transaction processing are expected to be available and highly responsive 24/7/365. These systems must be fault-tolerant and highly resilient to any failures that might happen during payment transaction processing.\r\nBuilding a low-latency payment system that spans multiple geographic locations requires a distributed caching solution for low latency and high-throughput data access. While building a real-time transaction processing system at Discover - one that is continuously available and can process thousands of transactions per second with a sub-second response time - we decided to introduce distributed caching technology into our architecture to minimize the latency and to replicate the data across multiple data centers. This presented numerous challenges:\r\n•\tHow to run Active-Active cache clusters in multiple deployment regions with high-availability\r\n•\tHow to auto-heal cache cluster failures due to network partitioning or disaster\r\n•\tHow to automatically failover client applications in response to failures\r\n•\tHow to automatically recover failed clusters to reduce MTTR\r\n•\tHow to ensure data consistency after the cluster is recovered\r\n•\tHow to implement a real-time monitoring and alerting solution for client and cluster connectivity\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take you through our journey of how we built a distributed caching solution to solve the challenges we faced.\r\n•\tConfiguration-driven and thread-safe smart client solution that can intelligently detect failures\r\n•\tAbility for the client application to failover if the error rate is above a certain threshold\r\n•\tAutomation to recover failed cluster and failback client connections after the cluster is recovered\r\n•\tWorkflow automation for data consistency after the cluster is recovered\r\n•\tReal-time streaming of client connectivity metrics\r\n•\tObservability solution to simplify operational support\r\n","startsAt":"2023-10-19T15:00:00","endsAt":"2023-10-19T15:50:00","speakers":["76e9f1bd-6816-419d-976f-8bed355214a6","4f132e2a-6b94-48bb-9a61-c270dff86b6a"],"categoryItems":[167587,167592,167604,167599,167605],"roomId":38472},{"id":"487520","title":"Who Goes There? Actively Detecting Intruders With Cyber Deception Tools","description":"Intrusion detection works best when you can discover the attacker while they are still in the system. Finding out after the fact does little to protect your systems and your data. \r\n\r\nIdeally, you would want to set an alarm that an attacker would trigger while limiting the damage to your environment.\r\n\r\nWe know from many recent breaches that attackers commonly try to expand their foothold in a system by finding and exploiting hardcoded credentials in environments they have accessed.  We can use these behavioral patterns to our advantage by engaging in defensive cyber deception.   \r\n\r\nYou might already be familiar with the concept of honeypots, false systems, or networks meant to lure and ensnare hackers. There is a subclass of honeypots that require almost none of the overhead, are simple to deploy, are used by many industries, and lure attackers to trigger alerts while they are trying to gain further access. The industry has arrived at the term honeytoken for this branch of cybersecurity tooling. \r\n\r\nTakeaways:\r\n- Analysis of recent breaches for common attack behaviors\r\n- A history of cyber deception and the evolution of honeypots in defensive strategies. \r\n- Understanding how honeytokens work\r\n- Maximizing the impact of honeytokens\r\n","startsAt":"2023-10-19T16:10:00","endsAt":"2023-10-19T17:00:00","speakers":["053bf183-629a-4dd5-b66e-e2b1d7142a49"],"categoryItems":[167586,167604,167602],"roomId":35721},{"id":"497485","title":"Unleashing ML Potential: Essential Design Patterns and MLOps Strategies for Business Solutions","description":"Machine Learning is on another hype cycle with generative interfaces such as ChatGPT and MidJourney pushing the edge on NLP and Image generation challenges.

Best to approach her in the wild with a sacrificial cup of coffee, and be forewarned: she's a hugger.","tagLine":"Code Mom, Cat Lady, Educator & Software Developer","profilePicture":"https://sessionize.com/image/ca9a-400o400o1-GqbwYws9d2eRn72hhA56Zr.jpg","links":[{"title":"Twitter","url":"http://www.twitter.com/not_unambitious","linkType":"Twitter"},{"title":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/toribrenneison/","linkType":"LinkedIn"},{"title":"Blog","url":"https://www.codemom.com","linkType":"Blog"},{"title":"Company Website","url":"https://www.techelevator.com","linkType":"Company_Website"}],"sessions":[492693],"fullName":"Tori Brenneison"}],"categories":[{"id":49208,"title":"Level","items":[{"id":167586,"name":"Introductory and overview","sort":1},{"id":167587,"name":"Intermediate","sort":2},{"id":167588,"name":"Advanced","sort":3}],"sort":0,"type":"session"},{"id":49212,"title":"Tags","items":[{"id":167601,"name":"AI & ML","sort":1},{"id":167592,"name":"Back-End","sort":2},{"id":167595,"name":"Cloud & Infrastructure","sort":3},{"id":167603,"name":"Data","sort":4},{"id":167594,"name":"Databases","sort":5},{"id":167597,"name":"Design","sort":6},{"id":167604,"name":"DevOps","sort":7},{"id":167593,"name":"Front-End &  Web","sort":8},{"id":167600,"name":"Hardware & IoT","sort":9},{"id":181275,"name":"Languages & Frameworks","sort":10},{"id":167591,"name":"Mobile","sort":11},{"id":167599,"name":"Patterns & Practices","sort":12},{"id":167596,"name":"Professional Skills","sort":13},{"id":167602,"name":"Security","sort":14},{"id":167598,"name":"Testing","sort":15},{"id":167605,"name":"Other","sort":16}],"sort":1,"type":"session"}],"rooms":[{"id":35721,"name":"River A","sort":-1},{"id":35722,"name":"River B","sort":0},{"id":35723,"name":"Ballroom C","sort":2},{"id":38471,"name":"Ballroom D","sort":2},{"id":38472,"name":"Ballroom E","sort":4},{"id":38473,"name":"Main Ballroom","sort":5}]}
